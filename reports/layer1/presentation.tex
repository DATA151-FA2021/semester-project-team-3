\frametitle{Plan}
We plan to use some categories to determine what could make a student in high school fail. 

Our current plan of attack is to first explore our data, since our dataset has many categorical and 
quantitative variables.

After investigating our dataset, we then are going to run the appropriate validation tests to ensure that our data
can be used by the appropriate statistical tests.
